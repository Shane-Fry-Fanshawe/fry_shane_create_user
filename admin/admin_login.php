  //When I was researching I saw that the above was not as secure as this:
  //Only difference was it doesnt display 2 characters in the same string but wouldnt that make it easier to determine? To me I think have more possible combinations ( such as 2 of the same letters) would make it harder to guess
  //vs something that you know cant have the same character (process of elimintation) & theres less combinations so i wasnt sure just leaving it, Im curious to see what you think is better
